    ///
    /// ```toml
    /// ### Optional: Default log level
    /// global_level = 'info'
    /// ### Optional: specify a regular expression to suppress all messages that don't match
    /// #global_pattern = 'foo'
    ///
    /// ### Specific log levels per module are optionally defined in this section
    /// [modules]
    /// #'mod1' = 'warn'
    /// #'mod2' = 'debug'
    /// #'mod2::mod3' = 'trace'
    /// ```
    ///
    /// You can subsequently edit and modify the file according to your needs,
    /// while the program is running, and it will immediately take your changes into account.
    ///
    /// Currently only toml-files are supported, the file suffix thus must be `.toml`.
